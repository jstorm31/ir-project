# Information Retrieval course project

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with Maven.

2. Add ir-tools library in IntelliJ IDEA

[Ir-tools](https://github.com/uiucGSLIS/ir-tools) library is used in the project and needs to be added manually as it isn't distributed with Maven. Built JAR of the library is located in `src/main/lib` folder. It just needs to be added to the project libraries.
